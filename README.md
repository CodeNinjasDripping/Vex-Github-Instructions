# Saving a VexIQ project to github section
  - If the repo already exists and you cloned it, then to push the updated version to github.com, you can start off on step 7. 

1. ![](1.png)
  - Open up github desktop (make sure you're signed into dripping springs account) and click on file -> new repository

2. ![](2.png)
  - This creates a local repository to the specific computer, not to github remotely
  - Name the repository the name of the student and then "-cs2n", like "studentName-cs2n" or "LoganFalkenberg-cs2n".
  - Create a local directory that will later be used to save their VexIQ code file in
  - Then click create repository

3. ![](3.png)
  - Click the button in the top that says "Public Repository"

4. ![](4.png)
  - Now we need to publish the repo to github remotely so we can access it from anywhere.
  - Name the remote repo the same as you named the local "studentName-cs2n"
  - Leave the description blank, keep the code private, and hit publish.

  - Open up the code file you want to save in VexIQ, and click "Save As"

6. ![](5.1.png)
  - Navigate to the local repository directory path you just created in github desktop. You'll know you're in the right place when the name of the directory matches what you put and you see a `.git` file in the repo. Name the code file "studentName-projectName". Click Save.

  - Go back to github desktop and you should see a new file in the software. Make the commit message the last step the student was working on, and then click "commit to main".

8. ![](7.png)
  - After it commits, then click the "push origin" button at the top to push the local code file to the remote repo.

9. ![](8.png)
  - To verify that this was done correctly, you can navigate to github.com and check the latest repo that was edited. Click on the repo and you should see the code file in the repo that you just saved from your local machine.
  - You are now done.

# Grabbing the file from github

1. ![](11.png)
  - Open up github desktop and click file -> clone repository

2. ![](12.png)
  - Type in the students name in the search bar, and you should see the desired repo pop up under it, choose a local directory to store it to (or create one) and click clone.
  - In the example image, I created my own and named it the same as the repo I was cloning to follow the naming convention

3. ![](13.png)
  - Open up VexIQ and click file -> open

4. ![](14.png)
  - Navigate to the local directory you just cloned the code file to, and clikc on the file and click open.

5. ![](15.png)
  - The code should now be able to be worked on, on your local machine. You are done.
